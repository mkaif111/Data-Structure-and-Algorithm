// You are given two positive numbers A and B. 
// You need to find the maximum valued integer X such that:

// X divides A i.e. A % X = 0
// X and B are co-prime i.e. gcd(X, B) = 1
// For example,
// A = 30
// B = 12
// We return
// X = 5

int gcd(int a , int b){
    
    return b==0? a : gcd(b,a%b);
}

int Solution::cpFact(int A, int B) {
    int ans = A;
    while(gcd(A,B)!=1){
        A = A/gcd(A,B);
        ans = A;
    }
    
    return ans;
}




// solution approach
// We can try to remove the common factors of A and B from A by finding the greatest common divisor (gcd) of A and B and dividing A with that gcd.

// Mathematically, A = A / gcd(A, B) —— STEP1
// Now, we repeat STEP1 till we get gcd(A, B) = 1.
// Atlast, we return X = A

// How does this work ?

// On doing prime factorisation of A and B, we get :

// A = p1^x1 . p2^x2 . … . pk^xk
// B = q1^y1 . q2^y2 . … . ql^yl
// Where pi ; i = 1, 2, …, k are prime factors of A and xi ; i = 1, 2, …, k are their respective powers
// Similarly, qj ; i = 1, 2, …, l are prime factors of B and yi ; j = 1, 2, …, l are their respective powers

// Let ri ; i = 1, 2, …, m be the common factors of A and B. By repeating STEP1, we are reducing the respective powers of ri by at least one, each time (Proof of this is left to the reader). Therefore, we reach a point where powers of ri become zero and product of the rest prime-powers in A form the largest divisor of A that is co-prime with B.
